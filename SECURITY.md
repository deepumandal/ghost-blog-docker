# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability within this Ghost Docker setup, please send an email to [deepu@workwithdeepak.org](mailto:deepu@workwithdeepak.org). All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Environment Variables
- **Never commit `.env` files** to version control
- Use strong, unique passwords for all services
- Rotate passwords regularly (recommended: every 90 days)
- Store sensitive information in secure password managers

### 2. Docker Security
- Keep Docker images updated to latest versions
- Use official images from trusted repositories
- Regularly scan images for vulnerabilities
- Limit container capabilities and use non-root users when possible

### 3. Network Security
- Use internal Docker networks for service communication
- Expose only necessary ports to the host
- Implement firewall rules to restrict access
- Use reverse proxy (nginx) for SSL termination

### 4. SSL/TLS Configuration
- Use Let's Encrypt for free SSL certificates
- Configure strong SSL ciphers and protocols
- Enable HTTPS Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
- Implement proper certificate management

### 5. Ghost CMS Security
- Keep Ghost updated to the latest version
- Use strong admin passwords with 2FA when available
- Regularly review user permissions
- Monitor admin access logs

### 6. Database Security
- Use strong MySQL passwords
- Limit database user permissions
- Regular database backups
- Enable MySQL slow query log monitoring

### 7. Server Security
- Keep host OS updated
- Configure fail2ban for brute force protection
- Use SSH key authentication
- Regular security updates and patches

### 8. Monitoring and Logging
- Monitor container logs regularly
- Set up log rotation to prevent disk space issues
- Use monitoring tools for resource usage
- Implement alerting for unusual activities
